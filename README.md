Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

    The code in this assignment that was given was the architecture and processes of the AI. The games design and the foundation of the AI were included. The parts that I designed were the steps that the AI had to complete in order to finish the game. Computer Scientists are responsible for the completion of projects and designs by using the techcnial abilities and knowledge they have developed. I approach my problems as a computer scientist by thinking of the best ways to save time, cost, and resources to the organization. My ethical responsibilites are to ensure that the code and AI I develop are using best practicies and are free of discrimination to all parties involved.
